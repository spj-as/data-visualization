# HW1 Scatter Plots
  Implement a web-based scatter plot to show the attached iris dataset by using D3.
# HW2 Parallel Coordinate Plots
  Implement a web-based parallel coordinate plot to show the iris dataset (the same as your homework #1) using D3. Users should be able to change the order of the axis because the attribute relations are difficult to observe if they are far away.
# Spotify Tracks Dataset
  Implement an integrated system that can show the insight of Spotify Tracks Dataset.
